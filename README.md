# Python-Dictionaries
 I'll be talking about a new Python type: the dictionary. Dictionaries are sooooo useful in the data world and to see this, imagine the following: you work for the World Bank and want to keep track of the population in each country. You can put the populations in a list. You start with Afghanistan, 30.55 million, Albania, 2.77 million, Algeria, around 40 million, and so on.
